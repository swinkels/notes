* GitHub fine-grained personal access tokens

A GitHub "fine-grained personal acces token" allows you to access a configurable
subset of your repos over HTTPS without the need for your username and password.
It also allows you to configure what holders of that token can do and these
permissions are truly fine-grained. The following screenshot show some of these
permissions:

To clone, pull from or push to a repo, you only need "*Read* access to metadata"
and "*Read* and *Write* access to code". The first one is mandatory and you need
it to "search repositories, list collaborators, and access repository metadata".
